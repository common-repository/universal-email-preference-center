* Fixed the issue related ActiveCampagian user name update issue.

[feature] [version 1.0.1]
* Fix the validate token function. I've made some changes to the 'validate token' function. Previously, the function sanitized the key while validating, but not while creating. I have  updated the function so that it sanitizes the key both when creating and validating.
* I have fixed an issue with the tamper protection feature. Enabling the feature should now activate the tamper protection functionality as expected.
* I have made some changes to the security vulnerability functions.
